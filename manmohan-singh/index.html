    <h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
    <article>
      Manmohan Singh, one of India’s most distinguished statesmen and
      economists, was born on September 26, 1932, in Gah, a village in what is
      now Pakistan. His early life was marked by the upheavals of Partition,
      during which his family migrated to India. Despite these challenges, Singh
      excelled academically, laying the foundation for his illustrious career.
      <br /><br />
      After completing his undergraduate studies at Panjab University, Singh
      pursued further education at the University of Cambridge, where he earned
      a degree in Economics. His thirst for knowledge led him to the University
      of Oxford, where he completed his DPhil in Economics. His doctoral thesis,
      which explored India’s export competitiveness, underscored his early focus
      on policies that could transform India’s economic landscape.

    <h2>Career and Achievements</h2>
    <article>
      Manmohan Singh’s career began in academia as a professor at Panjab
      University and later at the Delhi School of Economics. His sharp intellect
      and understanding of economic systems caught the attention of
      policymakers, leading to his appointment as an advisor to the Ministry of
      Commerce. From there, his journey into public service began.
      <br /><br />
      Singh held various key positions, including Chief Economic Advisor,
      Governor of the Reserve Bank of India, and Deputy Chairman of the Planning
      Commission. However, it was his tenure as India’s Finance Minister from
      1991 to 1996 that cemented his place in history. In a time of economic
      crisis, Singh’s reforms transformed India’s economy from a closed,
      socialist structure to a liberalized, market-driven model.
      <br /><br />
      In 2004, Singh was appointed as India’s 14th Prime Minister, becoming the
      first Sikh to hold the position. He served two terms, from 2004 to 2014,
      leading the country through periods of significant economic growth and
      social change. His tenure was marked by landmark initiatives such as the
      Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA), the
      Right to Information Act, and the Indo-U.S. Civil Nuclear Agreement.

    <h2>Economic Reforms and Legacy</h2>
    <article>
      Manmohan Singh’s most enduring contribution to India remains the economic
      reforms of 1991. Faced with a severe balance-of-payments crisis, Singh,
      under the leadership of then-Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha Rao, introduced
      policies that deregulated industries, reduced trade barriers, and
      attracted foreign investments. These measures not only stabilized the
      economy but also laid the groundwork for India’s emergence as a global
      economic powerhouse.
      <br /><br />
      Singh’s leadership was characterized by his calm demeanor, intellectual
      rigor, and unwavering commitment to India’s development. While his tenure
      as Prime Minister faced criticism for perceived inaction during his second
      term, his overall contributions to India’s progress remain undeniable.
      <br /><br />
      Beyond his economic achievements, Singh is remembered for his humility and
      integrity. His ability to work across party lines and focus on long-term
      national interests earned him respect from allies and adversaries alike.

      <strong>Conclusion:</strong> Dr. Manmohan Singh’s journey from a modest
      village in Punjab to the helm of Indian politics is a testament to his
      resilience, intellect, and vision. As an economist, he reshaped India’s
      economic trajectory. As a statesman, he led the country with dignity and
      purpose. His legacy continues to inspire policymakers and citizens,
      serving as a reminder that thoughtful leadership can drive transformative
      change.
